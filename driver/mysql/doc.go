/*
Package mysql implements MySQL syntax generator.

YOU ARE SUGGESTED NOT TO CREATE TABLE WITH THIS DRIVER IN PRODUCTION. It might cause huge
performance lost if issuing incorrect size for column/index.

This driver accepts four DSN parameters:

  - charset=utf8: Default character set for table and string fields.
  - collate=utf8_general_ci: Default collation for table and string fields.
  - stringKeySize=255: Max length of indexed string fields, cannot exceed 256.
  - blobKeySize=2048: Max key length for indexed []byte fields.

  For example:
  mysql:stringKeySize=32


String field mapping

String fields are mapped to TEXT type if not indexed.
For example:

  type A struct {
          S string `sdm:"s"`
  }

The column "s" will be TEXT type.

For indexed string fields, VARCHAR is used:

  type A struct {
          S1 string `sdm:"s1,pk_key1"`
          S2 string `sdm:"s2,idx_key2"`
          S3 string `sdm:"s3,uniq_key3"`
          S4 string `sdm:"s4"`
  }

Column "s4" will be TEXT type, others are VARCHAR(256) type.

Converting date and time types

TIME column CANNOT convert to time.Time, as they are semantically incompatible. Use string instead.

This driver supports auto-converting no matter what database/sql/driver your use. But for table creation, there is something special worth to note: As in MySQL 5.7, it is not allowed to set zero value to timestamp unless you manually unset related settings in "@@sql_mode". You MUST take care of it yourself.
